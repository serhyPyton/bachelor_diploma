One of the topical issues in computer vision is estimation of camera position by
point sets.
It is the basis of scanning objects using 3D scanner,
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

The object of the study is the method for estimation of camera parameters.

The subject of the study is the algorithm for matching point sets.

This study aims to explore the algorithm for the comparision of 3D point sets
as a method for evaluating the camera position and unknown parameters estimators
obtained using it.

To perform the study
\begin{itemize}
  \item the method of least squares was used to find efficient estimators of
  sought-for parameters;
  \item singular-value decomposition (SVD) was used to provide the orthogonality
  of the rotation matrix estimator;
  \item probability theory was used to prove the uniqueness of the extimates and
  to find their distribution.
\end{itemize}
